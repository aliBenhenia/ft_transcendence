# multi threading about workers 
# async is about tasks

'''

pause the execution of a coroutine until the result of another coroutine .

Non-Blocking Execution - Suspend and Resume - Concurrency Management

_______________________________________________________________________________

Used with Awaitable Objects:

Coroutines: Functions defined with async def.

Tasks: Objects created by asyncio.create_task() or loop.create_task().

Futures: Low-level objects representing an operation that hasnâ€™t completed yet.
