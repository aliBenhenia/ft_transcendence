# What is OAuth2?

OAuth2 is a way for users to give a third-party application access to their data without sharing their passwords.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[*] The Flow Step by Step:

    User Redirected to Authorization Server:
        
        The user wants to log into a third-party app using their 42 (a platform) account.
        The app redirects the user to the 42 platform’s authorization page.
        The 42 platform checks if the user is logged in. If they are, it asks if they want to allow the app to access their data.

[*] User Grants Access:

    The user agrees to give the app access.
    The 42 platform sends the user back to the app with a temporary code in the URL.

[*] App Exchanges Code for Access Token:

    The app takes the code and sends it back to the 42 platform to exchange it for an access token.
    The access token is a special key that allows the app to make requests to the 42 API on behalf of the user.

[*] App Makes API Requests:

    The app can now use the access token to request data from the 42 API.
    For example, the app might ask for the user's profile information, and the 42 API will respond with the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[*] Implementation:

    - Redirect Users to 42 Authorization:
        The app sends users to the 42 authorization URL, where they log in and grant access.
    
    - Authorization URL:

        https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/authorize?client_id=your_client_id&redirect_uri=http://yourapp.com/callback&response_type=code&scope=public&state=random_string

    client_id: The app's ID.
    
    redirect_uri: Where the user goes after granting access.
    
    response_type: "code" indicates the app is asking for an authorization code.
    
    scope: What data the app wants to access.
    
    state: A random string to protect against attacks.

    - Exchange Code for Access Token:

        - The app sends a POST request to get the access token:

        - POST https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token

    - Using the Access Token:

        The app includes the token in the header of API requests:

The OAuth2 flow allows a user to give an app permission to access their data without sharing their login details. 
The app first gets a code, exchanges it for an access token, and then uses that token to access the user’s data from the API.
